Aruba provides Cucumber helpers for command line programs, but it's way more sophisticated than I can understand,
so I wind up reinventing that wheel in miniature for a lot of projects. This is just an extraction of that.
It aims to be simple and easy to understand/extend.

It's barely featured, currently the only features are what I extracted from SeeingIsBelieving's test suite. I'll
add more to it as I need them, or you're welcome to. Its testing is entirely in cucumber at the moment, and there
are no negative tests to assert that things don't work, so if anyone winds up working on it, I wouldn't mind that.


To run tests
============

    cd tests
    bundle
    bundle exec cucumber
